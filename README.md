Launch the application on a computer connected to your display screen.
Open the browser in full-screen mode (F11 in most browsers).
Navigate to the application URL.

Standard View: Shows names and timestamps of recent check-ins.

Count View: Displays totals by category/location.

Split View: Shows both names and counts in a split-screen format.
Change the view by adding the ?mode= parameter to the URL:

Code
http://localhost:5000?mode=standard
http://localhost:5000?mode=count

üîÑ API Integration
This application uses the following PCO API endpoints:

Check-ins API: For accessing real-time check-in data.
People API: For retrieving additional person details (optional).
API requests are cached to minimize the number of calls and improve performance.

üß∞ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
No data appearing: Verify your PCO API credentials and check-in station ID.
Slow refresh: Check your network connection or adjust the refresh interval.
API rate limiting: Implement longer caching or reduce the refresh frequency.

Logs
Application logs are stored in logs/app.log. Check this file for error messages and debugging information.

üîí Security Notes
Keep your .env file secure and never commit it to version control.
This application should be run on a secure, internal network.
Consider implementing authentication if the display is publicly accessible.
